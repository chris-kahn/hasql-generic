# hasql-generic

This is a small library to add generic derivation of Hasql's row encoder and decoder types, `Hasql.Decoder.Row` and `Hasql.Encoder.Params`. See the code for usage examples.

Thanks to Andres Loeh for his help and some code required to make this work.

**warning** this library is currently in a very early stage, and therefore unstable and experimental
